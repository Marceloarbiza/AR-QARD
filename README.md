# AR-QARD

### AR-QARD is only a small part of a project.

### QARD, a dynamic business card in augmented reality that uses a web application to manage the data of each user. Its purpose is to keep the data updated, but above all to generate an impact on the person who receives it through augmented reality.

#### In this project I had the opportunity to be a spatialist in augmented reality.
#### Here I only bring from the whole project the AR interface.

#### - Multiuser (unlimited number of users in the AR engine (user = marker)).
#### - Updatable in real time (full QARD).
#### - Clickable icons in AR and these redirect to the web site that corresponds to the user.
